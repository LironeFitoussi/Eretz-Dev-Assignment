#Eretz Dev Assignment#
Welcome to the Eretz Dev Assignment repository! This project is designed as a front-end React checkout page and a Node.js backend server for an e-commerce website. The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your skills in React development, state management, API integration, testing, and front-end design.

Introduction
In this project, you'll be tasked with building a responsive checkout page for an e-commerce website using React. The checkout page should allow users to view a list of selected items, see the total price, and proceed with the checkout process by clicking a "Checkout" button. Upon clicking the "Checkout" button, the front end will send a POST request to the backend server with specific data including the selected items, customer information, and payment details.

Technical Requirements
Use React for the front-end development.
Implement state management for handling user input and application state.
Integrate with a Node.js backend server using API requests.
Utilize the Tailwind CSS framework for styling.
Write the application in TypeScript for improved type safety and code maintainability.
## Client

The client folder contains the front-end React application.
